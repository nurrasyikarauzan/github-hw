            <p> <font face="cooper black" , size 5</font>
                I spent my MCO days alone in my room,since I am stuck in college and most of my friends went back home. Only a few of my friends are here, so that is okay for me. Mostly my activities were watching movies, discovering new songs, eating, sleeping, and the rest is just spending my time alone.</p>

            <h2> My Activities </h2>
            <p> Most of my activities are just boring things. I watch Netflix, eat, walk around the campus, and clean my room almost everyday. that is basically what I do during MCO, and waiting for ODL starts.
